# Sentiment-Analysis-BikePrediction
To predict the demand for rental bikes at each hour by analyzing user reviews,social media posts and feedback
Problem Statement:
- In urban cities, bike rental systems face the challenge of making bikes available at the right time and location
- The key issue is predicting how many bikes are required per hour to reduce waiting time and ensure customer satisfaction

  Proposed Solution:
  We designed a machine learningbased sentiment analysis system that:
  1. Collects data from reviews,social media,surveys and support interactions.
  2. Cleans and preprocesses text (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization).
  3. Applies machine learning and deep learning algorithms for sentiment classification.
  4. Provides predictions to help city planners and bike rental companies optimize bike availability
